### Primary Interest
* **Software Defined Radio (SDR)**, I'am quite proficient in using GNU Radio tools and already made a few of Out-of-tree modules [(here)](https://github.com/handiko/CurriculumVitae).
* **Antenna and RF Design**, I'am experienced in designing and simulating various antenna using free software, like 4NEC-2 and MMANA-GAL. A few of the design results [1](https://handiko.github.io/4E-20M-YAGI/), [2](https://handiko.github.io/Rotary-WARC-Band-Dipole/), [3](https://handiko.github.io/3E-40M-YAGI/), [4](https://handiko.github.io/Portable-Yagi-10-15-2E/), [5](https://handiko.github.io/Yagi-4E-144/)
* **RF Data Telemetry & Data Communication**, I designed a hardware and wrote code and GNU Radio module to make an APRS Transmitter using an Arduino UNO and APRS receiver on GNU Radio using RTL-SDR [1](https://handiko.github.io/Arduino-APRS/), [2](https://handiko.github.io/Dorji-TX-Shield/), [3](https://handiko.github.io/gr-APRS/)
